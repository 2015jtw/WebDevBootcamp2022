    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>The Silkie (also known as the Silky or Chinese silk chicken) is a breed of chicken named for its atypically
        fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such
        as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four. They
        are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical
        characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It is among the most docile of
        poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves,
        laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due
        to their broody nature.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>It is unknown exactly where or when these fowl with their singular combination of attributes first appeared, but
        the most well documented point of origin is ancient China. Other places in Southeast Asia have been named as
        possibilities, such as India and Java.[1] The earliest surviving Western written account of Silkies comes from
        Marco Polo, who wrote of a "furry" chicken in the 13th century during his travels in Asia.[3] In 1598, Ulisse
        Aldrovandi, a writer and naturalist at the University of Bologna, Italy, published a comprehensive treatise on
        chickens which is still read and admired today. In it, he mentions "wool-bearing chickens" and ones "clothed
        with hair like that of a black cat".[4]

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>

    <p>Silkies are considered a bantam breed in some countries, but this varies according to region and many breed
        standards class them officially as large fowl; the bantam Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the
        time. Almost all North American strains of the breed are bantam-sized, but in Europe the standard-sized is the
        original version. However, even standard Silkies are relatively small chickens, with the males weighing only 1.8
        kilograms (4 pounds), and females weighing 1.4 kg (3 lb).[3] The American Standard of Perfection calls for males
        that are 1 kg (36 oz), and females that are 900 g (32 oz).[1]

    <h3>Bantams</h3>

    <p>In the American Standard of Perfection, the standard male weight for the bantam Silkie is 1 kg (35 oz) and for
        the female, 900 g (32 oz).[12] The Australian Poultry Standard and British Poultry Standard call for Silkie
        bantams much smaller; in the Australian, the standard weights are 680 g (25 oz) for males and 570 g (20 oz) for
        females.[13] The British standard weight for bantam Silkies is 600 g (22 oz) for males, and 500 g for females
        (18 oz).[14]
